# Fableaux Data Visualization

![Default Screen](./briefers/capture1.png)

Inspired by Tableaux, **Fableaux** is a 100% bootstrap-free implementation of React Native in conjunction with Google's Map API as an underlying base-layer.
Our aim here is to provide a similar functionality: putting lipstick on any data object that requires sophisticated, meaningful display, while correlating geo-location.
Our user experience (UX)revolves around geo-mapping "important" data, (in our prototype, cybersecurity events) hand in hand with typical data displays (pie, doughnut, bar charts etc.) that can be added and removed from the viewport. STRML react-grid is leveraged for this purpose, in addition to React PrimeFaces widgets.
