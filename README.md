This project is extending the STRML react-grid component for a specific need, namely, to provide standard queries and their data visualizations in a movable, removable, movable and resizable viewport. 

This is a pure react implementation with no bootstrap or jQuery. Chart.js is used in addition to ReactPrime widgets. Will publsih a ToDo as I move along.
