# SFableaux Data Visualization

![Default Screen](./briefers/capture1.png)

Fableaux is a 100% bootstrap-free implementation of React-Grid in conjunction with the Google's Map API as an underlying base-layer that was inspired by Tableaux. Our aim here is to provide a similar functionality: putting lipstick on any data object that requires sophisticated, meaningful display.

Our user experience (UX)revolves around geo-mapping user defined "important" data, in the prototype cybersecurity centric events, hand in hand typical data displays (pie, doughnut, bar charts etc.) that can be added and removed from the viewport. STRML react-grid is leveraged for this purpose, in addition to React PrimeFaces widgets.
